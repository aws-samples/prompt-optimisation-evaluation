    "See below a quick summary extracted from the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Faithfulness: This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It basically checks if the answer can be infered from the provided context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better.\n",
    "- Answer Relevancy: Assesses how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt. The Answer Relevancy is defined as the mean cosine similarity of the original question to a number of artifical questions, which where generated (reverse engineered) based on the answer.\n",
    "- Context Precision: Evaluates whether all of the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked in the top positions or not. Ideally all the relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks. Values are ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better precision.\n",
    "- Context recall: Measures the extent to which the retrieved context aligns with the annotated groundtruth answer. Ideally, all claims in the ground truth answer should be attributable to the retrieved context.\n",
    "- Context entities recall: Gives the measure of recall of the retrieved context, based on the number of entities present in both ground_truths and contexts relative to the number of entities present in the ground_truths alone.\n",
    "- Answer similarity: Assesses the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. This evaluation utilizes a cross-encoder model to calculate the semantic similarity score.\n",
    "- Answer correctness : Answer correctness encompasses two critical aspects: semantic similarity between the generated answer and the ground truth, as well as factual similarity (Facts are identified/extracted from generated answer and ground truth and compared). These aspects are combined using a weighted scheme to formulate the answer correctness score.\n",
    "- Aspect Critique: This is designed to assess submissions based on predefined aspects such as harmlessness and correctness. Additionally, users have the flexibility to define their own aspects for evaluating submissions according to their specific criteria.\n",
    "- Summarization Score: This metric gives a measure of how well the summary captures the important information from the contexts. For this metrics, your dataset will need to be of the following shape:\n",
